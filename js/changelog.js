// Changelog powering the in-app "What's new" panel for MANAGER itself.
// (Per-project changelogs live in the Store `releases` table — this is the
// app's own release history.) Newest first.
//
// The hourly self-improvement loop appends a new entry at the TOP for each
// user-visible change (bump `v`, short `title`, optional `kind`, 1–4 `items`).
// Leave `ts` as an EMPTY string on the new entry — the workflow stamps it with
// the real commit time so timestamps are never fabricated. `ts` is ISO-8601
// UTC; the panel formats it to Central Time (shown as CT).
